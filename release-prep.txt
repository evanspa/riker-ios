Do the following in preparation for a release:
----------------------------------------------
+ manually increment the "version" config value from within Xcode (Riker target
-> 'Version' field on the 'General' screen).  You have to do this manually
because the agvtool only seems to update the 'Build' value.
+ commit all code to git
+ run "./release <VERSION>"

Example:

./release.sh "1.7-b23"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ Immediately after creating the IPA and uploading it to Apple, do the
following:

- Go back into Xcode and increment the build version and number.

- Go into RLocalDaoImpl.m and adjust the R_REQUIRED_SCHEMA_VERSION constant
  accordingly.  Create a new applyVersion<#>SchemaEditsWithError: method and
  incorporate it into the switch/case within the
  initializeDatabaseWithSqliteDataFilePath:error: method if needed.

- Once the build is uploaded to iTunes and has been processed, download the
  symbol files and upload them to firebase using the upload script.
